# Save-Script
This is a python script that work in conjunction with a workflow (you need Workflow for ios) to enable open scripts .py (Only .py for now) and save it directly on Pythonista
The workflow link is: https://workflow.is/workflows/8cdee57f79664205a6a565c9cbdb3d48

Updated: Script updated to ask destiny extension, using the @JonB suggestion, so if you have a .pyui change its extension to .py then “open in” then in pythonista select .pyui extension, it’s not perfect but it’s all I have now.
